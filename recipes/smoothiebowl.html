        <h3> Ingredients </h3>
        <p> 
            <ul>
                <li> 1 cup frozen mixed berries </li>
                <li> 1 small ripe banana (sliced and frozen)</li>
                <li> 2-3 tbsp light coconut milk</li>
                <li> 1 scoop plain or vanilla protein powder of choice (optional)</li>
                <li> 1 tbsp shredded toppings (coconut or otherwise)</li>
                <li> 1 tbsp chia seeds </li>
                <li> 1 tbsp hemp seeds</li>
                <li> granola </li>
                <li> fruit of choice</li>
                <li> any other fitting toppings</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <p>
            <ol>
                <li> Add frozen berries and banana to a blender and blend on low until small bits remain (see photo).</li>
                <li> Add a bit of coconut or almond milk and protein powder (optional), and blend on low again, scraping down sides as needed, until the mixture reaches a soft serve consistency (see photo). </li>
                <li> Scoop into 1-2 serving bowls (amount as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size) and top with desired toppings (optional). I prefer chia seeds, hemp seeds, and coconut, but strawberries, granola, and a nut or seed butter would be great here, too</li>
                <li> Best when fresh, though leftovers keep in the freezer for 1-2 weeks. Let thaw before enjoying.</li>
            </ol>
